SYNOPSIS
       nibbles [ -vh?  ] [ port ] [ -f logfile ] [ -s logsize ] [ -r fileamount ] [ -d debuglog ] [ -c configfile ]




DESCRIPTION
       <B>nibbles(8)</B>  is  a console tool for listening and filtering prints sent over UDP. Nibbles supports filtering print lines based on keystring lists. User can add strings which
       cause lines including string to be excluded, included or highlighted. nibbles can also be used for sending ethernet messages, and to  find  definitions  /  structures  from
       include  files. Nibbles also allows storing and loading ethernet frames to text file. In order to enable definition finding, you need to create .nibbles folder in your home
       directory and create Interface folder with headers into it. Nibbles recurses through folders and files in Interface at startup. Nibbles also uses msgtemplate file  contain‐
       ing saved ethernet packets from ~/.nibbles folder. You can also place default configuration file in .nibbles folder. see RUNTIME COMMANDS and -c from OPTIONS. NOTE: If val‐
       ues are given from command line they will override values from configuration file. If values are not given from configuration file or command line, then hardcoded  defaults
       are used. By default nibbles listens ports 51001, 51003 and 51035. No filters are applied by default.



OPTIONS
       -p --port
              UDP port to listen. It is possible to specify multiple ports by giving multiple -p options

       -c --config
              configuration  file  for default UDP ports and filters. One can specify ports to listen, filters and also udp log file where prints are stored in configuration file.
              N.I.B.B.L.E.S understands following lines from file:

              port=portnumber

              filter=filterstring

              udplog=logname

              For filterstring syntax see FILTER QUEUES section below. On linux N.I.B.B.L.E.S searches .nibbles/default.conf from users home directory if no -c option is given. If
              no config file at all is found, N.I.B.B.L.E.S opens ports 51001, 51003 and 51035 and listens them without any filters.

       -f --file
              followed by name of UDP log file. Enables logging prints to file.

       -s --size
              size of udp log file. After size fills up, nibbles creates new file and continues. New file's name is appended with incrementing number. You need to also specify -f,
              -s without -f is ignored. (This parameter is ignored by nibbles ultrabra).

       -r --rotate
              if nibbles is instructed to create multiple files (see -f and -s), -r can be used to limit the number of kept files. When number of files is written,  nibbles  over‐
              writes oldest log. -r without -s and -f is ignored. (This parameter is ignored by nibbles ultrabra).

       -d --debug
              followed by name of debug log file. Enables debug logs (usefull mainly for people interested in tweaking N.I.B.B.L.E.S).

       -v --version
              display version and exit

       -h --help
              When first include filter is applied, N.I.B.B.L.E.S stops showing all prints which do not contain at least one include keystring. It does not matter if print matches
              highlight or exclude filters. Strings can be added as include filters by typing plus sign + immediately followed by  intended  include  filter  string  and  pressing
              enter.

       highlight filters
              When print line has passed include and exclude rules, it is still searched for highlight keystrings. If print contains highlight string, it is highlighted using col‐
              ors. This naturally requires that used terminal supports colors. Strings can be added as highlight filters by typing ! immediately  followed  by  intended  highlight
              filter string and pressing enter.

              User  can  also  specify filters as comma separated list. Eg -spam,+emails,!important,!Matti would add filters to exclude every print not containing word emails, and
              also exclude every print containing word spam. Prints passing those rules and containing words important or Matti, would be highlighted. NOTE: due to  this  keywords
              cannot contain commas.


RUNTIME COMMANDS
       In addition to setting filters at runtime user can issue commands ctrl+p to pause screen, buttons from F2 to F6 can be used tp toggle showing of different function screens.
       F2 displays runtime help screen, F3 enables ethernet packet sender and F4 pops up definition finder to help building ethernet messages. F5 can be  used  to  view  installed
       filter strings. F6 displays a list of packets stored in msgtemplate file.ESC quits program. C (followed by enter) clears the log window.


FILES
       sample.config
              Sample configuration file.
       msgtemplates
              Sample file for defining ethernet messages.
       ~/.nibbles/default.conf
              Configuration file sourced by default at startup.
       ~/.nibbles/msgtemplates
              File sourced at startup used for defining ethernet messages.
       ~/.nibbles/Interface
              Folder where C structure typedefs and other definitions are searched at startup.



BUGS
       Filter keystrings cannot contain commas. Definition finder is pretty limited parser, only able to parse typedefs of certain formats.
